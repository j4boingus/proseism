      <p>How quick the mound of scramble eggs turns from more than half the mound of scrambled eggs to less than half the mound of scrambled eggs 
Just one uncalculated 
Or attempted calculated 
Spoon
It’s almost like there is no equilibrium 
No true half
Or at least you’ll never find it
Outside of maths 
Or the intense autism that results in you, not only being German, 
But being German on a tv game show about perfectly cutting objects like bagels or blocks of cheese into two perfect (-ly weighted) halves
As if it wasn’t hard enough to be German to begin with 
not only was the inherent supremacist attitude, be it white or otherwise 
Or the unthought nature in which they enforce “objective” truth
Or their feigned acknowledgments of their collective, previous, horror only to weaponise again in order to enact the very same horror
Not only all that 
But they chose to make slicing bread, a sport 
Worth broadcasting
Drinking games with Germans are more like drinking sports 
Laden with rules, which they willingly, knowingly leave unmentioned
For it to benefit them in the future of this inconsequential game 
“Yea man - we’re all really impressed that you cheated to win the game that’s sole objective is to make people participate in drinking”
Suppose that’s probably impressive in Germany to other Germans
Like eating dog shit is probably impressive to other dogs 
Hence their gross proclivity for it

I can’t rap 
Like I can “sing” along to rap
Do you rap along to rap?
I can really understand a lot of rap 
I can’t do it 
A narrow destiny that probably consumes most of us 
Cast to be non-rappers 
Born to rap 
Forced to write 
Words just don’t go together for me in the rap world
Not that I ever wanted to be in it
Rachel told me I was a poet 
In speaking
I always thought I was kinda retarded 
Saying things that don’t explicitly make sense 
Mostly to fill the gaps in the vacant air
Between sips of whatever drink i may hold
But some meaning could be derived
If perhaps you have a pretty face
And maybe it’s packaged well
Maybe lust maybe fantasy 
That I was a poet and she could tell her friends she fucked a poet
Make it seem less pathetic than a desperate fuck from a man 7 years her lesser
It’s sad women have to make up these excuses 
Perhaps it’s women enforcing it on other women
Probably men forcing it on women forcing it on women 
Men make good puppet masters whether knowing or unknowing 
Like those Jew millionaires controlled by Irish billionaires controlled by Albanian trillionaires 
Albanians are the true rulers of the world 
I suppose framing me a poet was convienent too
Especially when you fill your shelves with books that no one knows but the other people who also fill their shelves with the same books know you have the book that goes in the bookshelf for this very purpose
And they look are your aphex twin vinyl album seldom played if ever at all, but definitely there
Or autecher if you are trying to break stride and stand above the others you have this social agreement with
Along with ceramics of indistinct use or shape
An ashtray is basically just a shitty bowl 
Or a coaster 
Or an incense holder
Ceramics that look like what happens when you turn up the stroke on a random shape in something like illustrator or photoshop
The obligatory book preloved but suspiciously flat 
Like purchased pre read
Almost rotten in their stale frail thin discoloured attic condition 
Smelling of air unmoved and with moderate to some moisture
Not enough to melt it back to pulp or a mouldy cheese style book
Amplifying that stink of who may have or never have loved it 
The shelves like diplomas and degrees in “I have the right to be-ology”
And the vintage fairs they go to to exchange currency for permission 
That affluent coffee shop 
That imitates a book enthusiasts book room
Deliberately lacking shelves to show books don’t rest 
They are constantly in flux 
These books no longer books 
But symbols of books 
Coffee table accoutrements 
Fittingly in the coffee shop 
That begs for tips, near demands tips 
Alongside books youll never read for the same price as a reasonably functional bike
Not one that rides well 
But one that rides nonetheless 

Alexa worked in one of those stores but I can’t remember which one 
I know Natalie did too
How do I keep ending up in bookstores, especially books stores of the same owner/owners
As an illiterate 
Sleeping reader
Serial 20 page reader 
I never really get past the 20th page of anyone 
Rachel, Alexa, Natalie 
I didn’t even get past the first page of Natalie 
But that was deliberately secretive and known to be based on her distinctly “in search of” profile 
She called herself Amelia or something like that
I remember it was vaguely polish 
Nothing like Natalie 
And her images of nothing 
And a final image zoomed in to what was definitely
Light marking the bellybutton and waist and those small long vertical peaks on either side of the belly button that I believe, anatomically, is something to do with the abdomin 
It’s clear what the purpose of this profile is 
Acquisition 
For a book person she had few words to say 
it might be a sort of American misconception that quantity equals quality 
And I have found from my many 20 page reads that characters within books at least the desirable ones don’t really say anything at all
They hinge circumstance on their lack of ___
Maybe a look a silence an action
And the narrator does the rest
Perhaps she’s narrating in her head 
.The illustrious dark maiden, on her eyes dark circles not from lack of sleep or Crohns disease but of some Levantine migration at one point or another. Her secretive matchmaking away from what she wishes was the unknowing clasp of her husband but sadly within the agreed permissions and probably preknown state of her caretaker, this silken dark olive toned woman tall and oldish in age but not old in the suppleness of her skin and the weight of her breast on their primordial hinges, the body a society doesn’t allow women over the age of 25 to have, she takes her anonymous hunting to the text thread.
“710 Seneca ave? Later?”
Definitive distinction between “later” and “tonight” 
Later implies there is no tonight 
Tonight I have plans 
Plans with my husband
Who is definitely not a potato and/or a legume
And the plans are: we sleep in the same bed 
“I’m looking for someone who can throw me around”
..
“Let me check you out first come to senaca bring something to drink, and no funny business”
Me clearly in the funny business, relieved that she accidentally triple negatived herself into my safe space 
Imagining that I actually want to throw her around the place and she’s told me I can’t 
But I never wanted to in the first place, infact it scares me 
To perform a barbaric pseudo masculine act for her perceived animalistic wants
I think she just wanted to return bruised to her husband 
To provoke something in him to act
In his in actionless existence
And I couldn’t/didnt want to do that 
Walking in my timberlands 
A poor choice for the specific event of unclothing myself which was for an act of god 
Bound to happen
My trousers destined to be remove or at least lowered before time is allocated to the untying of shoelaces
Women never seem to wear shoes that come off difficultly 
Either that or theyre really good at taking them off 
Or double either that they never plan to wear tied shoes in the expectation of males
Perhaps like a vagina recently shaved in a way signalling expectation 
Shoes untiable or tieless may be the green light 
Men are not attuned or wise enough to look for 
In films written by men, specifically american men, a fumbling nervous idiot may be preferred
In reality not so much
I walk past Izzy’s place, her and Chelsea inside unknowing of the fact I was sneaky walking past them for a sneaky moment with a sneaky woman 
I stand outside the place, a donut 
Waiting on this ridden grass carpet 
A nice thought for the moment it was placed there but with no sight for its future
This dirty moist beaten scrap of fake grass unevenly cut a long its perimeter 
At points you see where the cutter got angry that whatever blunt shears they were using werent cutting the mustard 
in this case cutting the astroturf
I arrived on time but no one’s here 
You think someone in the market for not being seen would be a bit more punctual 
Could this be the moment I get abducted have my organs harvested and et cetera
Suppose I’m not really a girl so like what would they do with me other than take my kidneys and such 
Like they’re not gonna rape me
Probably better off killing two birds with one stone
Why two abductions for one rape and one organ harvest 
When you can do one for both
Reassured in my own stupidity
I return to the grass from my slight meander down the street a little to distance myself from the exact location I was to be abducted from 
Finally this figure appears not from the designated location but walking down the street 
And not in the way a person walks down the street to somewhere 
More in the way that a person walks towards a fentanyl leaning street man facing the opposite direction resembling a confused older old person from behind 
The kind you might try to help cross the street or open a door 
Thankfully her approach to me was as she expected, not a fentanyl person, or a catfish either
“Let’s take a walk”
Who am I to deny a walk it’s not like it’s minus 16 or anything but given the circumstances I can empathise 
I do have like 3 jackets on also
This seasoned woman had given me a safe location as though it was her address 
A very wise move almost chess like 
In order to preserve her anonymity if this brisk walk didn’t go so well
